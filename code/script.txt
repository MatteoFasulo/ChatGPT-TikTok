There once was a man named Jack who believed he was the luckiest person ever. He won the lottery three times, survived a plane crash, and even found love on his last dollar. His friends envied him and marveled at his good fortune.

One day, as he was walking home, he stumbled upon a lost wallet. Inside was a winning lottery ticket worth millions. Jack couldn't believe his luck and immediately cashed it in. But as he walked out of the bank, he was struck by lightning and died on the spot. Moral of the story: Sometimes, too much luck can be dangerous.
